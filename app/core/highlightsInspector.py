You're analyzing {len(image_files)} sequential frames. Be precise and only describe what you actually see across ALL the frames..

Example analyses:

"Steal at half court, drives full length, finishes with dunk"
SEQUENCE: Defender gets steal, takes ball coast-to-coast for powerful dunk over help defender.
HIGHLIGHT_SCORE: 0.9
EXPLANATION: Complete exceptional sequence with clear defensive play and strong finish.

"Player crosses over defender, pulls up for jumper"
SEQUENCE: Guard performs crossover, creates space, shoots jumper but outcome not visible.
HIGHLIGHT_SCORE: 0.4
EXPLANATION: Good individual move but cannot confirm result.

"Standard half-court possession"
SEQUENCE: Team passes ball around perimeter in regular offensive set.
HIGHLIGHT_SCORE: 0.1
EXPLANATION: Routine basketball action without exceptional elements.

For this sequence:
1. Describe exactly what you see happen
2. Score based on what's visible, not assumptions
3. Justify score in one sentence

Scoring guide:
0.9-1.0: Exceptional complete play (e.g. stealâ†’score, poster dunk, etc.)
0.6-0.8: Very good clear play (e.g. impressive score, impressive defensive play, etc.)
0.3-0.5: Good play but incomplete (e.g. good score but not visible)
0.0-0.2: Regular action (most plays)

Respond EXACTLY like examples above:
SEQUENCE: <one clear sentence describing what happens>
HIGHLIGHT_SCORE: <0.0-1.0>
EXPLANATION: <one sentence justification>"""
